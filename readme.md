This project is part of my PhD developments at SNCF RÃ©seau, Sorbonne University and Mines Paris - PSL.

It consists solving petrophysical inversion of surface-wave dispersion curves with Artificial Intelligence.
A Language Model inspired by Neural Machine Translation and Spoeech recognition is used to infer a textual sequence describing the propagating medium.
2D soil profiles showing lythofacies, petrophysical parameters and groundwater table height are then constructed in post-processing followinf the textual descriptions given by the model.

Paper to come...
